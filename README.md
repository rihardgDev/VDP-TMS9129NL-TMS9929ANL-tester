DIY VDP TMS9129NL/TMS9929ANL tester. VDP chip is a video chip from Texas Instruments used in multiple 8-bit home computers (TI-99/4A, MTX, SVI 328, MSX). As far as I see TMS9129NL/TMS9929ANL are pin compatible more on the topic can be found here (https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/hardware/tms9929anl-vs-tms9129nl), but I'm not sure on exact differences. (I did not create the project just sharing it, to preserve the code.
